## Introduction

This guide will show you how to install the 6.6.0-bacta kernel for the Lenovo Legion Go. This kernel should bring performance improvements, in some games more than others. In my testing I have seen up to a 19% performance improvement depending on game and resolution.

This kernel is a port of NeroReflex's 6.6.0 kernel for the ROG Ally, special thanks to NeroReflex for assisting in the port.

### Step 1 

Create a directory to store the kernel packages in and download them...

```mkdir /home/gamer/src```

```cd src```

```mkdir 6.6.0-bacta```

```cd 6.6.0-bacta```

```wget https://github.com/bactaholic/chimeraos-legion-go-tricks/releases/download/6.6.0-bacta/linux-bactaholic-6.6.0.bacta-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst```

```wget https://github.com/bactaholic/chimeraos-legion-go-tricks/releases/download/6.6.0-bacta/linux-bactaholic-headers-6.6.0.bacta-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst```

### Step 2

Both files should now be inside the 6.6.0-bacta folder. Your terminal should already be inside that directory, if not you can get there via ```cd /home/gamer/src/6.6.0-bacta```, Now we need to install these files. In your terminal run...

```pacman -U *.tar.zst```

wait until it finishes installing before proceeding.

***Disclaimer*** : If it fails to install try running ```sudo frzr-unlock``` and try again once finished.

### Step 3

Now the kernel should be installed. Next we need to tell the system to use it at boot. But first lets verify that the files are in fact in the right place using ```ls /boot```, you should see the following files in the /boot directory...

```vmlinuz-linux-bactaholic```

```initramfs-linux-bactaholic.img```

```initramfs-linux-bactaholic-fallback.img```

if you see those 3 files, we are ok to proceed modifying our boot loader entry to switch kernels. Run the following command...

```sudo nano /boot/loader/entries/frzr.conf```

this should open the frzr.conf boot entry in a text editor, and you should see something along the lines of this...

```
title chimeraos-45_8da6d18
linux /vmlinuz-linux
initrd /amd-ucode.img
initrd /intel-ucode.img
initrd /initramfs-linux.img
options root=LABEL=frzr_root rw rootflags=subvol=deployments/chimeraos-45_8da6d>....
```

change the ```vmlinuz-linux``` line to ```vmlinuz-linux-bactaholic``` and change ```initramfs-linux.img``` to ```initramfs-linux-bactaholic.img```, it should look something like this when complete...

```
title chimeraos-45_8da6d18
linux /vmlinuz-linux-bactaholic
initrd /amd-ucode.img
initrd /intel-ucode.img
initrd /initramfs-linux-bactaholic.img
options root=LABEL=frzr_root rw rootflags=subvol=deployments/chimeraos-45_8da6d>....
```

***WARNING: DOUBLE AND TRIPLE CHECK THE SPELLING FOR THE frzr.conf BOOT LOADER ENTRY, ANY MISTAKES WILL RESULT IN THE SYSTEM REFUSING TO BOOT, REQUIRING A REPAIR OR FRESH INSTALL***

Once done, save and exit, then run...

```sudo systemctl reboot```

Once rebooted, check the System tab in your Settings (in game mode), you should see that you are now on 6.6.0--bactaholic-1

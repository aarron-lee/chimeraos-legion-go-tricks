# Experimental Sound Fix v2

## IF ON BAZZITE OS, THIS FIX HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE OS ALREADY.

## IF ON CHIMERA OS, THIS FIX HAS BEEN ADDED

> This sound fix applies a surround sound convolver profile, similar to Dolby Atmos for Built-In Speakers

> The built-in speakers with a volume slider that acts as master gain, and then the virtual sink sliders that apply surround sound profiles on top of the master gain sink. Basically, this lets you adjust the overall gain separate from the sinks themselves to give a wider level of control. Itâ€™s not the most seamless solution but it seems to do the job.
